# Arduino_Matlab_Communication
Condes to allow arduino and matlab communication
IMPORTANT!!! 
Before using the matlab code you have always to upload the code in arduino first, and then run the matlab code. If you need to use input and output in the same code, just merge the codes i am sharing and you will have everything in one arduino and matlab code.
